            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p class="subtitle"><strong>BookVentures</strong> · Last Updated: February 2026</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <strong>The short version:</strong> We collect minimal data, don't track you, don't show ads, and don't sell your information to anyone.
            </div>

            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>BookVentures ("the App") is a reading tracker app that helps you log your reading history, discover your reader archetype, and find your next favorite book. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices.</p>

            <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
            
            <h3>Reading History (User-Provided)</h3>
            <p>When you log books in BookVentures, we store:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Book titles and authors (selected from our catalog)</li>
                <li>Completion dates</li>
                <li>Your ratings (1-10 scale)</li>
                <li>Your notes and reviews</li>
                <li>Books on your To-Be-Read list</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This data is stored locally on your device and, if you're signed into iCloud, syncs across your Apple devices via Apple's CloudKit service.</p>

            <h3>Book Catalog (Pre-Loaded)</h3>
            <p>The App includes a pre-loaded catalog of 6,200+ books with metadata, cover image URLs, and literary analysis data. This catalog data is bundled with the App and does not contain any personal information.</p>

            <h2>Information We Do NOT Collect</h2>
            <p>BookVentures does <strong>not</strong> collect, access, or store:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your location</li>
                <li>Your contacts</li>
                <li>Your photos or camera</li>
                <li>Device identifiers or advertising IDs</li>
                <li>Health or fitness data</li>
                <li>Browsing history</li>
                <li>Any biometric data</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We do <strong>not</strong> use analytics, tracking services, advertising networks, or third-party SDKs that collect data.</p>

            <h2>How Your Data Is Stored</h2>
            
            <h3>Local Storage</h3>
            <p>Your reading history is stored on your device using Apple's SwiftData framework. This data is protected by your device's built-in encryption.</p>

            <h3>iCloud Sync (Optional)</h3>
            <p>If you're signed into iCloud on your device, your reading history automatically syncs across all your Apple devices via Apple's CloudKit service. This sync is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Encrypted in transit and at rest</li>
                <li>Managed by Apple's privacy infrastructure</li>
                <li>Subject to <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/">Apple's Privacy Policy</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can disable iCloud sync in your device's Settings → [Your Name] → iCloud.</p>

            <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
            
            <h3>Apple CloudKit</h3>
            <p>We use Apple's CloudKit to sync your reading history across devices. Apple processes this data according to their privacy policy. We do not have access to your iCloud account credentials.</p>

            <h3>Open Library (Cover Images)</h3>
            <p>Book cover images are loaded from Open Library (openlibrary.org), a project of the Internet Archive. When the App displays a cover, your device makes a request to Open Library's servers. No personal data is sent with these requests.</p>

            <h3>No Other Third Parties</h3>
            <p>We do not use Google Analytics, Facebook SDK, Firebase, or any other third-party services that track users.</p>

            <h2>Your Data Rights</h2>
            
            <h3>Export Your Data</h3>
            <p>You can export your complete reading history as a CSV file at any time:<br>
            <strong>Settings → Data → Export Reading History</strong></p>

            <h3>Delete Your Data</h3>
            <p>You can delete all your reading history at any time:<br>
            <strong>Settings → Data → Clear Reading History</strong></p>
            <p>This removes data from your device and, if using iCloud sync, from all synced devices.</p>

            <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
            <p>We do <strong>not</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sell your personal information</li>
                <li>Share your data with advertisers</li>
                <li>Share your data with data brokers</li>
                <li>Use your data for marketing purposes</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>BookVentures does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. The App does not require account creation and stores data locally on the device.</p>

            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p>We implement appropriate technical measures to protect your data:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>All data is stored using Apple's secure frameworks</li>
                <li>Network requests use HTTPS encryption</li>
                <li>No custom authentication or password storage</li>
                <li>No server-side storage of user data</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy.</p>
